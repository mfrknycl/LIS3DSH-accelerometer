# LIS3DSH for stm32

The [LIS3DSH](https://www.st.com/resource/en/datasheet/lis3dsh.pdf) is a three-axis linear accelerometer. The LIS3DH application note can be found [here](https://www.st.com/resource/en/application_note/cd00290365-lis3dh-mems-digital-output-motion-sensor-ultra-low-power-high-performance-3-axis-nano-accelerometer-stmicroelectronics.pdf).

It communicates over I2C or SPI protocols, but in this library only I2C was used.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

**To include this library, add** `#include "LIS3DH_device.h"` **at the begging of the code**

### Prerequisites

You will need to install **Keil Development Tool** for this project.
